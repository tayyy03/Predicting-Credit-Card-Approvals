# Predicting-Credit-Card-Approvals
This project aims to predict credit card approvals using machine learning techniques. We use a dataset that contains various information about the applicants and whether their credit card application was approved or not.

## Code Overview
The code snippet provided shows the initial data preparation steps:
```python
X=df.drop('not.fully.paid', axis=1)
y=df['not.fully.paid']
y = y.astype(int)
y = pd.to_numeric(y, errors='coerce')
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.33)
```
Here's a brief explanation of the code:

```python
X=df.drop('not.fully.paid', axis=1)
```
This line drops the 'not.fully.paid' column from the dataframe df and assigns the remaining columns to X. This is done because 'not.fully.paid' is our target variable, which we want to predict.


```python
y=df['not.fully.paid']
```
This line assigns the 'not.fully.paid' column to y, which is our target variable.

```python
y = y.astype(int)
```
This line converts the 'not.fully.paid' values to integers.

```python
y = pd.to_numeric(y, errors='coerce')
```
This line further ensures that all values in y are numeric, converting any errors to NaN.

```python
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.33)
```
This line splits the data into training and testing sets. 33% of the data is used for testing, and the rest is used for training the model.

## Next Steps
After these initial data preparation steps, the next steps would typically involve data preprocessing (like handling missing values and categorical data), training a machine learning model with the training data, and then evaluating the model with the testing data.

## Data Preprocessing
Data preprocessing is a crucial step in any machine learning project. It involves cleaning the data and making it suitable for a machine learning model. This includes handling missing values, converting categorical data to numeric data, and possibly scaling the data.

## Model Training
After preprocessing the data, the next step is to train a machine learning model with the training data. This involves choosing a suitable machine learning algorithm and fitting the model to the training data.

## Model Evaluation
After the model has been trained, it's important to evaluate its performance. This typically involves using the model to make predictions on the testing data and then comparing these predictions to the actual values. Common metrics for evaluating a model's performance include accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

## Conclusion
This project is a great example of a typical machine learning workflow. It involves preparing the data, training a model, and evaluating the model's performance. With this workflow, we can predict credit card approvals with a high degree of accuracy.
